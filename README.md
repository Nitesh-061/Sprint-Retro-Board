# Sprint-Retro-Board
## A web application that will allow multiple users to log in to the web application and post their respective comments and collaborate in real time.

Created a dashboard, which will allow team members to share comments during retrospective meetings. 
During software development, a team usually carries out scrum retrospective meetings to share their comments on a sprint. 
These comments can be positive (plus), improvement (delta), and appreciation (star).
